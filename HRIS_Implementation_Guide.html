Let's go step-by-step clearly and simply to get you started smoothly.<br>
Here's your First Step clearly defined:<br><br>
ðŸš© Step 1: Requirements Gathering and Use Case Validation<br>
What You Need to Do:<br><br>
Identify and Schedule Interviews with:<br><br>
HR Department (to understand processes like onboarding, leave, attendance).<br>
IT Department (to know the technical constraints, existing infrastructure).<br>
Selected employees and managers (to capture user perspectives, pain points, expectations).<br><br>
Document Current Processes:<br>
Employee onboarding workflow<br>
Leave application and approval workflow<br>
Employee data management workflow<br><br>
Tools to use: Visio, Lucidchart, or draw.io.<br><br>
Define User Roles & Permissions clearly:<br>
HR Admin<br>
Employees (ESS - Employee Self-Service)<br>
Managers (MSS - Manager Self-Service)<br>
IT Admin/System Admin<br><br>
Validate and Finalize MVP Scope:<br>
Employee master data CRUD operations<br>
Leave management (Apply, Approve, Reject, View)<br>
Basic chatbot interactions (leave balances, FAQ)<br><br>
Identify AI Automation Fitment:<br>
Document potential chatbot use-cases clearly.<br>
Consider auto-tagging for uploaded employee documents.<br><br>
ðŸ“‘ Deliverables at End of Step 1 (by the end of Week 1):<br>
Business Requirements Document (BRD) clearly detailing goals, functional/non-functional needs.<br>
User Journey Map & Personas: Document clearly visualizing interactions for different user types.<br>
Use Case Catalog clearly outlining employee and leave management scenarios.<br>
Stakeholder Matrix clearly stating roles, responsibilities, influence, and involvement.<br>
AI Feasibility Notes clearly identifying opportunities and constraints.<br>
Tooling & Infrastructure Checklist clearly identifying required Azure and Microsoft components.<br><br>
Please confirm once you've initiated this step, and I'll guide you through the next. If you need any specific templates or examples now, let me know!<br><br>
