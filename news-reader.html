The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has significantly expanded its bailout program requirements for Pakistan, adding 11 new conditions and bringing the total to 50 structural benchmarks and conditions. According to the Express Tribune, among the key new requirements, Pakistan must secure parliamentary approval for a Rs 17.6 trillion budget, implement higher debt servicing surcharges on electricity bills, and remove restrictions on the import of used cars older than three years.

The IMF has also expressed concern about the potential impact of rising India-Pakistan tensions on the program's success. The IMF’s staff-level report, released on Saturday, cautioned, “Rising tensions between India and Pakistan, if sustained or deteriorate further, could heighten risks to the fiscal, external and reform goals of the programme.”

Here are IMF’s 11 new conditions for Pakistan:
1. Parliamentary approval of Rs 17.6 trillion federal budget.
2. Pakistan must pass a new budget for FY 2025–26 in line with IMF programme targets by June 2025.
3. Agricultural Income Tax reform at provincial level – laws by June.
4. Governance action plan – publish strategy based on IMF’s diagnostic.
5. Post-2027 financial sector strategy.
6. Annual electricity tariff rebasing by July.
7. Semi-annual Gas Tariff Adjustment by Feb 2026.
8. Make Captive power levy ordinance permanent by May.
9. Remove Rs 3.21/unit debt servicing surcharge cap.
10. Phase-out STZ fiscal incentives by 2035.
11. Liberalise used car import (up to 5 years old) via legislation by July.
12. Allocate Rs 1.07 trillion for development in budget.
