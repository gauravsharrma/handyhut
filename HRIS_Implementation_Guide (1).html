<p>Let's go step-by-step clearly and simply to get you started smoothly.
Here's your First Step clearly defined:

ðŸš© Step 1: Requirements Gathering and Use Case Validation
What You Need to Do:

Identify and Schedule Interviews with:

HR Department (to understand processes like onboarding, leave, attendance).

IT Department (to know the technical constraints, existing infrastructure).

Selected employees and managers (to capture user perspectives, pain points, expectations).

Document Current Processes:

Employee onboarding workflow

Leave application and approval workflow

Employee data management workflow

Tools to use: Visio, Lucidchart, or draw.io.

Define User Roles & Permissions clearly:

HR Admin

Employees (ESS - Employee Self-Service)

Managers (MSS - Manager Self-Service)

IT Admin/System Admin

Validate and Finalize MVP Scope:

Employee master data CRUD operations

Leave management (Apply, Approve, Reject, View)

Basic chatbot interactions (leave balances, FAQ)

Identify AI Automation Fitment:

Document potential chatbot use-cases clearly.

Consider auto-tagging for uploaded employee documents.

ðŸ“‘ Deliverables at End of Step 1 (by the end of Week 1):

Business Requirements Document (BRD) clearly detailing goals, functional/non-functional needs.

User Journey Map & Personas: Document clearly visualizing interactions for different user types.

Use Case Catalog clearly outlining employee and leave management scenarios.

Stakeholder Matrix clearly stating roles, responsibilities, influence, and involvement.

AI Feasibility Notes clearly identifying opportunities and constraints.

Tooling & Infrastructure Checklist clearly identifying required Azure and Microsoft components.
